Tum Bin 2 is a film that pays homage to the classic Bollywood love triangles of the past. It has all the elements of a melodramatic romance: a tragic accident, a love triangle, a twist of fate and a sacrifice. The film also boasts of some soulful songs composed by Ankit Tiwari and sung by Arijit Singh, Rekha Bhardwaj and others.
 
The film has received mixed reviews from critics and audiences. Some have praised the film for its emotional appeal, performances and music, while others have criticized it for its cliched plot, slow pace and lack of originality. The Times of India gave the film 3 stars out of 5 and said, "Despite the odds, if you like old-fashioned love stories with great music, Tum Bin 2 is a partially heartrending tale that can be watched for its beautiful message and sincere execution."
