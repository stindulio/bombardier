GT Designer 3 is a software tool that allows you to create and edit screens for Mitsubishi HMI (Human Machine Interface) devices. It is part of the GT Works 3 package that also includes GT Simulator 3 and GT SoftGOT 3. With GT Designer 3, you can design graphical interfaces for various models of GOT2000 and GOT1000 series.
 
However, to use GT Designer 3, you need to have a valid license key that matches your HMI device. Otherwise, you will not be able to download or transfer your projects to the HMI. This can be a problem if you lose your license key or if you want to use a different HMI model than the one you purchased.

Fortunately, there is a solution for this issue. You can use a keygen program that can generate valid license keys for any HMI model supported by GT Designer 3. A keygen is a software that can create serial numbers or activation codes for various software products. By using a keygen, you can bypass the license verification process and use GT Designer 3 without any restrictions.
 
One of the most popular keygens for GT Designer 3 is Gtdesigner3keygen. This is a small executable file that can run on any Windows computer. It does not require installation or registration. All you need to do is to download it from a reliable source and run it on your computer.

1. Open Gtdesigner3keygen.exe and select your HMI model from the drop-down list.
2. Click on Generate button and copy the license key that appears on the screen.
3. Open GT Designer 3 and go to Help menu. Select License Management and then License Registration.
4. Paste the license key that you copied from Gtdesigner3keygen and click on Register button.
5. Restart GT Designer 3 and enjoy using it with your HMI device.
