The film begins with Kabir Malhotra (Anupam Kher), a billionaire tycoon, inviting four people to his private island in Greece. They are Neil Menon (Abhishek Bachchan), a casino owner in Istanbul; Vikram Kapoor (Jimmy Sheirgill), a Bollywood superstar; Tisha Khanna (Shahana Goswami), a crime journalist; and OP Ramsay (Boman Irani), a politician from Thailand. None of them know why they have been invited, but they soon discover that they all have a connection to Maya (Sarah-Jane Dias), Kabir's daughter, who died under mysterious circumstances.
  
Kabir reveals that he knows the secrets of the four guests and accuses one of them of killing Maya. Before he can reveal the name of the killer, he is shot dead by an unknown sniper. The island is then locked down by security forces led by Sia Agnihotri (Kangana Ranaut), an officer from the International Vigilance Squad. Sia interrogates the four suspects and tries to find out the truth behind Maya's death and Kabir's murder.
  
As the investigation proceeds, more secrets and lies are exposed, and the motives of each suspect become clearer. The film takes the audience on a thrilling ride across different countries and continents, with twists and turns at every corner. Game is a film that explores the themes of revenge, betrayal, love and justice.
