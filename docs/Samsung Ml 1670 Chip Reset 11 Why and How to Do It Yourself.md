# How to Reset Samsung ML 1670 Printer Toner Chip
 
If you own a Samsung ML 1670 printer, you may have encountered a problem where the red light on the printer starts blinking or stays on, indicating that the toner cartridge needs to be replaced. However, sometimes this happens even when you know that there is still toner left in the cartridge. This is because the toner cartridge has a memory chip that records the toner usage and prevents you from printing more pages than the manufacturer's limit.

Fortunately, there is a way to reset the toner chip and extend the life of your cartridge. This tutorial will show you how to do it in a few simple steps. Note that this method only works for printer firmware version v1.01.00.4 or v1.02.00.4. You can check your firmware version by printing a configuration page or by removing the right cover of your printer and looking at the label on the board.
 
Before you start, make sure that your printer is installed to your PC and that you have downloaded the reset software from [this link](http://www.mediafire.com/?ltzc30357t6...). Also, be aware that resetting your printer voids warranty and may cause damage or malfunctions. Proceed at your own risk.
 
1. Turn off your printer and take out the toner cartridge. Cover the chip on the right side of the toner with a piece of tape. Return the toner back inside.
2. Turn on your printer and put a sheet of paper in it.
3. Open the reset software folder and run "usbprn2.exe". A command prompt window will appear.
4. Type "ML-1670\_V1.01.00.4.fls" or "ML-1670\_V1.02.00.4.fls" depending on your firmware version and press enter.
5. The software will start sending data to your printer. Do not turn off your printer or disconnect it from your PC during this process.
6. When the software finishes, it will display "Download Complete". Press any key to exit.
7. Turn off your printer and remove the tape from the toner chip.
8. Turn on your printer and enjoy printing with your reset toner cartridge.

Why do you need to change the chip on the toner cartridge? The main reason is that the chip is designed to stop working after a certain number of pages or when the toner level reaches zero. This means that even if you refill the toner cartridge with new toner, the chip will still tell the printer that the cartridge is empty or expired and prevent you from printing. Therefore, you need to replace the chip with a new one or reset it with a special tool.
 
What are the benefits of resetting the toner chip? There are two main benefits of resetting the toner chip: saving money and protecting the environment. By resetting the toner chip, you can reuse your existing toner cartridge and avoid buying a new one. This can save you a lot of money in the long run, especially if you print frequently. Moreover, by reusing your toner cartridge, you can reduce the amount of waste and pollution caused by discarded cartridges. According to some estimates, more than 375 million cartridges are thrown away every year, which contributes to landfill and greenhouse gas emissions. By resetting your toner chip, you can help conserve natural resources and reduce your carbon footprint.
 
How to reset the toner chip? There are different ways to reset the toner chip depending on your printer model and firmware version.

Some printers require you to replace the chip with a compatible one. You can find more information about how to reset your specific printer model online or by contacting your printer manufacturer or supplier.
