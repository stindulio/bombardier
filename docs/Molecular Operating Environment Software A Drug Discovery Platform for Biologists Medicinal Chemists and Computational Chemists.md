Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) is a drug discovery software platform that integrates visualization, modeling and simulations, as well as methodology development, in one package. MOE scientific applications are used by biologists, medicinal chemists and computational chemists in pharmaceutical, biotechnology and academic research[^1^] [^2^]. MOE runs on Windows, Linux, Unix, and macOS.

MOE covers a wide range of applications in molecular design, such as structure-based design, fragment-based design, ligand-based design, pharmacophore discovery, medicinal chemistry applications, biologics applications, structural biology and bioinformatics, protein and antibody modeling, molecular modeling and simulations, virtual screening, cheminformatics and QSAR[^2^]. MOE also has a built-in command, scripting and application development language called Scientific Vector Language (SVL) that allows users to customize and extend the functionality of MOE[^2^].
 
MOE is developed by Chemical Computing Group (CCG), a private company based in Montreal, Canada. CCG was founded in 1994 by Paul Labute, who is the current President/CEO of the company[^3^]. CCG has a team of mathematicians, scientists, and software engineers who constantly update and improve MOE to meet the needs of the scientific community[^4^]. CCG also provides training, support and consulting services to its clients[^4^].
 
MOE is a commercial software that requires a license to use. However, CCG offers a free trial version of MOE for academic users who want to evaluate the software before purchasing it. The free trial version of MOE has all the features and capabilities of the full version of MOE, except that it expires after 30 days. To download the free trial version of MOE, academic users need to fill out a request form on CCG's website. CCG will then send an email with instructions on how to download and install MOE on their computers.
 
MOE is a powerful and versatile software platform that can help researchers in various fields of molecular design. By downloading the free trial version of MOE, academic users can explore the features and benefits of MOE without any cost or obligation.
  
Some of the benefits of using MOE software for molecular design are:
 
- MOE provides a user-friendly molecule editor that supports multiple file formats and allows users to create and modify molecules easily.
- MOE offers a choice of proven force fields for molecular mechanics and dynamics calculations, such as AMBER, CHARMM, MMFF94, OPLS-AA and OPLS-2005.
- MOE has a powerful modeling application that can perform various tasks, such as conformational analysis, pharmacophore elucidation, QSAR modeling, docking, virtual screening, fragment-based design, protein engineering and antibody modeling.
- MOE is customizable and flexible, as users can write their own scripts and applications using SVL or integrate MOE with other software tools using its API.
- MOE provides training, support and consulting services to its clients through CCG's team of experts.

To learn more about MOE software and its features, users can visit CCG's website or watch the video library that showcases various applications of MOE.
