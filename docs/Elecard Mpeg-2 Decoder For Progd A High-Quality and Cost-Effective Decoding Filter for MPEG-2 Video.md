Using Elecard MPEG-2 Decoder for Progd is simple and straightforward. After you install the package, you can open any MPEG-2 video or audio file with your Windows Media Player or any other DirectShow-based application.

To use the Elecard Streaming Pack application, launch it from the Start menu and enter the URL of the stream in the Source field. Then click Play to start receiving and decoding the stream.
3. To adjust the decoding quality and performance, you can use the Elecard MPEG-2 Video Decoder Properties dialog box. To access it, right-click on the video window and select Filters > Elecard MPEG-2 Video Decoder. In this dialog box, you can change various settings such as brightness, contrast, saturation, deinterlacing mode, DXVA mode, CPU usage limit, and more.
4. To enable or disable special decoding modes, such as low latency mode or thumbnail generation mode, you can use the Codec API interface. To access it, right-click on the video window and select Filters > Elecard MPEG-2 Video Decoder > Codec API. In this dialog box, you can set various properties such as CODECAPI\_AVLowLatencyMode or CODECAPI\_AVDecVideoThumbnailGenerationMode.
