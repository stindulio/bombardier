Lord Ganesha is one of the most popular and beloved deities in Hinduism. He is worshipped as the god of new beginnings, wisdom and luck, and the remover of obstacles. He is also the patron of various fields of knowledge and arts, such as literature, music, mathematics, and science. He is depicted as having an elephant head and a human body, with four arms holding different objects such as an axe, a noose, a goad, and a bowl of sweets. He rides on a mouse or a rat, which symbolizes his ability to overcome any obstacle.
 
There are many stories and legends about the origin and adventures of Lord Ganesha. One of the most common ones is how he got his elephant head. According to this story, Ganesha was created by his mother Parvati from the dirt of her body while she was taking a bath. She asked him to guard the door while she was bathing and not to let anyone enter. Meanwhile, her husband Shiva came back from a long journey and wanted to see his wife. But Ganesha did not recognize him and refused to let him in. Shiva became angry and cut off Ganesha's head with his trident. Parvati was devastated when she saw what had happened and demanded that Shiva bring her son back to life. Shiva agreed and sent his attendants to find the head of any creature that was sleeping with its head facing north. They found an elephant and brought its head to Shiva, who placed it on Ganesha's body and revived him. Parvati was overjoyed and embraced her son. Shiva also blessed him and declared that he would be the first god to be worshipped before any other god or any auspicious occasion.

Another popular story is how Ganesha broke one of his tusks. There are different versions of this story, but one of them is that Ganesha was asked by the sage Vyasa to write down the epic Mahabharata as he dictated it. Ganesha agreed on the condition that Vyasa would not stop or pause in his narration. Vyasa agreed but also made a counter-condition that Ganesha would have to understand everything he said before writing it down. As Vyasa narrated the complex and lengthy epic, Ganesha wrote it down with his tusk as a pen. But at one point, his tusk broke and he did not have any other writing instrument. He did not want to break his promise or interrupt Vyasa, so he quickly broke off another piece of his tusk and continued writing with it. Thus, he completed writing the Mahabharata with his own sacrifice and dedication.
 
Lord Ganesha is celebrated in various festivals throughout the year, but the most important one is Ganesh Chaturthi, which falls in late August or early September. On this day, devotees install clay idols of Ganesha in their homes or public places and worship him with prayers, offerings, songs, and dances for ten days. On the eleventh day, they immerse the idols in water bodies such as rivers or lakes, symbolizing Ganesha's return to his abode in Mount Kailash with his parents Shiva and Parvati. This festival is especially popular in Maharashtra and other parts of western India.
